HaarCascade Frontal Face Algorithm:
-> Numerous amount of human faces has been trained and binded to this algorithm using ML techniques. 
-> Use integral image concept to find face features like eyes,nose,mouth. 
-> We use this algorithm to detect human face.

FisherFace recogniser algorithm:
-> Extracts principle components that seperates one individual from other.
